I am a Ph.D. in Computer Networks currently working as a research and teaching assistant at the  [University of Strasbourg](https://www.unistra.fr/), in the [Networks Teams](https://reseaux.icube.unistra.fr/en/index.php/Home) of the ICube laboratory. 

My work focuses around routing, from inter-domain routing to intra-domain traffic engineering. I have also worked on Internet topology discovery on large-scale monitoring.

I have also taught ~ 400h in the past 4 years (and thoroughly enjoyed doing so!).
